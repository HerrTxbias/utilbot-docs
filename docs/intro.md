# Introduction
Hey! You successfully found the Online-Documentation for the Utilbot! This is meant to be a Help to use the Bot. You will find all Commands, all Changelogs, just **EVERYTHING** here!

## Bugs
If you experience any Bugs, *please* let me know on my [Discord Server](https://utilbot.co/discord)! You're also welcome there, if you just wanna hang around and meet some new people. You can do anything there (as long it's in compliance with the Rules of course).

## Important Information
We currently do **not** support Stage Channels as we wait for the library update (We are still on Discord API Version 6). The new upcoming Feature called ["Threads"](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/pull/2855) will *also* take some time to implement, as we need to wait for the library update. We are sorry for the inconvenience.
