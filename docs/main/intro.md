# Introduction
Hey! You successfully found the Online-Documentation for the Utilbot! This is meant to be a Help to use the Bot. You will find all Commands, all Changelogs, just **EVERYTHING** here!

## Bugs
If you experience any Bugs, *please* let me know on my [Discord Server](https://utilbot.co/discord)! You're also welcome there, if you just wanna hang around and meet some new people. You can do anything there (as long it's in compliance with the Rules of course).

## Important Information
We currently do **not** support Stage Channels as we wait for the library update (We are still on Discord API Version 6). However if you're living on the edge, you can test the canary version of the Utilbot. We support stage channels in this version, as we are using the discord.js development branch there.
We are also starting to implement more Slash Commands on our Canary Version.

The new upcoming Feature called ["Threads"](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/pull/2855) will *also* take some time to implement, as we need to wait for the library update. We are sorry for the inconvenience.

### Deprecated Commands / Features
With the upcoming Major Release, we are going to remove some Commands or Features.
If you have a look in a page of a Command there will be a note, if this command / feature is deprecated.
There is also Hint in the [command overview](../commands/command-overview).
