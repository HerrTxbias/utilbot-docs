# Bot Versions
We currently have three seperate Versions of the Bot running:
- [Utilbot](#utilbot)
- [Utilbot Canary](#utilbot-canary)
- [Utilbot Internal](#utilbot-internal)

## Utilbot
This is the Main Instance of the Bot. It is running the latest stable Version of our Code and will be restarted only on failures / outages or when we update our Code.
Note that this Documentation is always for the latest Version of the Bot. There may be some Pages that will have an information, that this features may only be available in our Canary Version.

## Utilbot Canary
If you're living on the Edge and you always want to be on the latest state, this version may the best choice for you. This is our public beta version of the bot, where we test new features or breaking changes on our end. Be aware, that this bot is more likely to restart often and may have some problems executing Commands. You should report any Bugs on this Bot in our [Discord Server](https://utilbot.co/discord).

## Utilbot Internal
This is our internal bot instance we use for private testing and debugging purposes. You may only see this bot in our support server, or on servers which are used by the developers to test new things.
