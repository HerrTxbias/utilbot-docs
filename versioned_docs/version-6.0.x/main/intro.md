## Bugs
If you experience any Bugs, *please* let me know on my [Discord Server](https://utilbot.co/discord)! You're also welcome there, if you just wanna hang around and meet some new people. You can do anything there (as long it's in compliance with the Rules of course).

### Deprecated Commands / Features
With the upcoming Major Release, we are going to remove some Commands and Features.
If you have a look in a page of a Command there will be a note, if this command / feature is deprecated.
