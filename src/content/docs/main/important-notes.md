## Permissions

All Permissions listed in the Specific Commands are explained more in the
[Discord Developer Documentation "Bitwise Permission Flags"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags)

## Guild Features

Some Commands need specific Guild Features to work (e.g. the Support Threads feature, which uses Private Threads).
They are also explained more in the [Developer Documentation "Guild Features"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-object-guild-features)
